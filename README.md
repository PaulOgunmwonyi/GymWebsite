## Smarter Lifts
Problem statement: Throughout my gym journey I've found it annoying having to manage multiple different 
apps and websites to keep track of my stats. These include recording my workouts in a Google Docs, tracking 
my calories in a tracker app, and calculating my one rep maxes and caloric needs on the web. 

Solution: I want to build a web application that will implement all of these functions in one application to 
reduce hassle. The various services of the application will also build off each other to reduce the need for 
constant user input. These advantages will not only improve existing gymgoers workload but also encourage 
non-gymgoers due to the ease of access to important information.
